# SRE-to-ODF-Engineering escalation path

## Purpose

This SOP describes how the SRE Team will escalate issues to the ODF engineering Team in case of incidents which would require help from ODF engineering to resolve them.

## Scope

The scope of this escalation path is to cover the incidents which have unavailability/data loss associated with the customer and none of the existing SOPs help to resolve the respective incident at the same time.

## Prerequisites

* `MTSRE` Role permissions over OCM.

## Responsibilities

* SRE to only escalate the issue to engineering on an urgent basis when the incident is associated with unavailability or data loss for the customer.
* ocm-cli version 0.1.63

## Procedure

### Determine whether the incident leads to unavailability / data loss for the customer

The best way to determine this is to see if the corresponding provider cluster has any storageconsumers or not.

* Determine the cluster ID of the Provider cluster associated with the customer, in case it's not directly available from PagerDuty incident: Happens when the incident's source is an ocs-consumer.

* Backplane access into the provider cluster (Checkout [References](#References) for the SOP to do so).

* See if there are any storageconsumers or not.

```
oc get storageconsumers.ocs.openshift.io -n openshift-storage
```

If there are no storageconsumers, then wait until the next set of ODF's working hours to escalate the issue to engineering.

### Escalation path when the incident urgently requires help from ODF Engineering

* Follow the steps in https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/openshiftplatformsre/wiki/how_to_sre_escalate_towards_engineering, starting with submitting the Google Form, to get help from the ODF Engineering Team.

### If above steps do not work follow the manual steps to escalate to ODF Engineering Team
 
* Fetch certain details of the impacted cluster:
    * Cluster Details: 
    ```
    ocm describe cluster <internal/external-id-of-cluster>
    ```
    For example
    ```
    ‚ùØ ocm describe cluster 1s0q9mp65e2f370q9s7ip75g6sj0sifg

* Open a Jira ticket in the [RHOSDFP Jira board](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHOSDFP) with the following details:

    ```
    Basic Details:

    Addon name: 
    Addon version: <can be gotten via `oc get csvs -n <addon-namespace>` on the affected cluster>
    OCP version: 
    Business Impact: 
    Description: 

    Cluster and Customer Details: <output of the following command> `ocm describe cluster <internal-id>`


    Pagerduty Incident: <PD URL pointing to the incident>


    Additional Operators which came with the addon (including the core addon's operator): \<output of the following command from inside the affected cluster> `oc get csvs -n openshift-storage`
    ```

    (Example ticket mentioned in the [References](#References))
    
* Open a google chat thread in [ODF Managed Services Escalation](https://mail.google.com/chat/u/0/?zx=545uzcc7jlkp#chat/space/AAAAOdTnXXo)
    * @hey odf-cae-team I need engineering assistance with \<RHOSDFP ticket you created>
    * Then in the next message in the thread provide a short description of the issue.
* One of the Engineering escalation contacts is expected to ack the escalation coming from SRE in under 15 minutes and involve the right set of engineering team on the issue.
* Get in touch with the associated person of ODF Engineering and get on a bridge call with them if need be to resolve the issue.
* If there is no acknowledgement by the engineering escalation contacts, a call should be made to the engineering escalation contact as per [this table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKvxXnxoIaIPW-tbONnZ1t9Pmec5TH2qYgDzAKSKtO4/edit#bookmark=kix.x1bsgr3rpjx6).
